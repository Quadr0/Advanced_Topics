Digit Recognition Lab

Author: Daniel Katz

To run or train the network, run the digit_recognition.py file.
To run the drawing feature, run the draw_digit.py file.

Notes:
- Run the apps from the root directory.
- The parameters for the network can be found at the top of the digit_recognition.py file.
- Do not change the number of nodes in each layer.
- The runtime_files directory contains the data, eps drawing file, and edge weights.
- The bigger and more centered the drawn numbers, the more accurate the prediction usually.
- What the model sees from a drawn image and the guess is displayed in the terminal.
- A well trained model is the prexisting edge_weights file which works well for drawing digits.

Required Installs:
- tkinter (should come with the python standard library)
- numpy
- pillow

Bugs:
- No known bugs.

Motion Planning Lab

Author: Daniel Katz

Notes:
- You must have the graphics library that is at the first link in the citation to run the program.
- The program uses the standard computer format for a coordinate plane.
- The y will always be entered before the x when the user is prompted for a point on the plane.
- When the graphic representing the plane pops up, it might hide the key for the graphic in the terminal. Drag the pop up the top bar to move it.
- There is an almost impossible statistical possibilty that the program will infitelly try to generate invalid obstacles.

Bugs:
- No known bugs.

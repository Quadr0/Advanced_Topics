    <h1>Welcome to the Instructions.</h1>

    <p>This game only has one win condition and one lose condition.</p>
    <p>The win condition "breaking" all the bricks with the ball.</p>
    <p>The lose condition is letting the ball hit the bottom wall.</p>

    <br>

    <p>When the ball is not moving, the game has either not begun or not reset.</p>
    <p>You can look below the game to find how many 
        games you have either won or lost.</p>
    <p>After a game, you can press the "reset/play another game" button to reset
        after a game or restart in the middle of a game.</p>
    <p>The ball will randomly go either to the left or to the right at the
        start of each round.</p>
    <p>You can adjust the speed of the game with slider at the bottom.</p>
    <p>The speed can be changed at any time but will only adjust between rounds.</p>
    <p>The lower the number, the faster the game moves as the number dictates how often the
         game refreshes in milliseconds.</p>
    <p>You can have more control over which direction the ball goes in by hitting the ball with
        the side or corner of the paddle.</p>

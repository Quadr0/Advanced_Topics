    <h1>Welcome to the instuctions.</h1>

    <p>This game only has one win condition and one lose condition.</p>
    <p>The win condition "breaking" all the bricks with the ball.</p>
    <p>The lose condition is letting the ball hit the bottom wall.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When the ball is not moving, the game has either not begun or not reset.</p>
    <p>You can look below the game to find how many 
        games you have either won or lost.</p>
    <p>After a game, you can press the "reset/play another game" button to reset
        after a game or restart in the middle of a game.</p>

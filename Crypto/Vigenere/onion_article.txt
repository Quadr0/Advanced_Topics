From The Onion:
THE PROS AND CONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

As technology advances to the point where machines have almost human-like capabilities, humanity is left to ponder the consequences involved with either advancing or holding back the field of computer sentience. Here are the pros and cons of artificial intelligence:
PRO
Wouldn’t be as embarrassed of human race’s progress when aliens make contact
Can be employed to perform dangerous tasks like informing blue-collar workers they are being replaced by machines
Ponderous editorials on the ethical dangers of AI composed in .000003 nanoseconds
Freed from the necessities of daily jobs, Americans can finally get working on their novellas
Someone, somewhere, will definitely profit from it
Emotionless workforce would save companies thousands on costly team-building exercises
Kind of a given at this point
CON
Hyper-efficient machines would allow corporations to devalue human employees for the sake of profits
Working as an accountant all that Dave has
Upsets humanity’s law of natural selection under which those born into privilege have first crack at running everything
Electricity bill too damn high as it is
Infinitely powerful cognition stands to make them pretty condescending
Risks thousands of stable ethicist jobs
Every film, book, and TV show that’s ever been made on the subject
